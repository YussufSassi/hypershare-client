# Hypershare frontend

This frontend is written in NextJS with MUI. It's still pretty bare-bones but it gets the job done.

## Setting it up

First, you need to edit or create `.env.local` with the following info:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<Your API URL (no trailing slash)>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL=<Your frontend URL (no trailing slash)>
```

## Run dev server

`npm run dev`

## Build for production

`npm run build`

## Start production server

`npm start`
